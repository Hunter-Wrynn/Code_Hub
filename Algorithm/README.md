# Practice Problem Collection

Welcome to the collection of practice problems! This repository contains a variety of algorithmic challenges to help you improve your problem-solving skills. The problems range from basic to advanced, and they cover a wide range of topics. Let's get started!

## Repository Structure:
This repository is organized into three main folders:

- **Algorithm_Pattern**: Contains algorithm templates that provide solutions for common problem types.
- **Code_Blog**: Includes my code blog.
- **Practice**: Contains all the practice problems and their solutions. This is where you can find the challenges to work on and improve your skills.

## Problem 1: Generate Numbers in Lexicographical Order

# leetcode 386. 字典序排序

给你一个整数 `n`，按字典序返回范围 `[1, n]` 内所有整数。你必须设计一个时间复杂度为 **O(n)** 且使用 O(1) 额外空间的算法。

**示例 1：** 输入：`n = 13` 输出：`[1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`  
**示例 2：** 输入：`n = 2` 输出：`[1,2]`

**提示：** 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
